# Wind Turbine Energy Output Prediction


This project focuses on predicting the energy output of a wind turbine based on various weather conditions. Users can input their city's weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure, to get real-time information. Additionally, by providing theoretical power curves, current wind speed, and wind direction, the application predicts the wind energy produced by a wind turbine

## Features

- Weather Data Input: Users can enter their city to obtain weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.
- Energy Output Prediction: Based on the input weather data and theoretical power curves, the application predicts the energy output of a wind turbine.
- User-Friendly Interface: The website provides an easy-to-use interface for entering data and viewing predictions.


## Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS for the front-end
- Python for data processing and prediction algorithms
- APIs for fetching real-time weather data
## Future Enhancements

- Integration of more advanced machine learning models for better prediction accuracy
- Addition of historical data analysis for long-term energy output trends
- Improved user interface for a more seamless experience


## Prerequisites
